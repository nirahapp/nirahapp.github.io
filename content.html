<h2
id="do-you-want-to-streamline-your-incomingoutgoing-webhook-process">Do
you want to streamline your incoming/outgoing webhook process?</h2>
<p>Do <em>you</em> want a webhook solution which works very well with
unreliable user endpoints, gives you monitoring &amp; visibility into
your systems, offers rate limiting for endpoints, can tackle a host of
security concerns, and offers a great development experience by
minimizing operational work that engineers have to do?</p>
<p><strong>Do</strong> <strong><em>you</em></strong> <strong>really want
to assign a team of 3-4 engineers for 4-6 months and thus spend Rs.
1.5-2 Cr/500-600k USD in salaries and build it yourself?</strong></p>
<p>Sending webhooks should have been easy, after all, it’s just an HTTP
request which is fired, right? Well, these are the questions which
lurk:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What happens when the receiver server is down/has faulty
deployment?</li>
<li>How does the receiver verify the authenticity &amp; source of
message?</li>
<li>How do you make sure the receiver is not overwhelmed?</li>
<li>How do you ensure visibility &amp; logs into all delivery attempts
to fix broken endpoints?</li>
<li>How much load can your servers handle to process, store and
forward the webhooks?</li>
<li>How do you get alerts if receiver endpoints have downtime?</li>
<li>How do you take care if webhooks were missed but the state change
has to be communicated to the receiver in some or the other way? If your
webhooks are as critical as payment credit alerts, you wouldn’t want
inconsistent payment states in different systems, right?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Value Proposition</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Sending Webhooks:
<ol type="1">
<li>Automatic Configurable retries</li>
<li>Idempotency</li>
<li>Event types &amp; labels</li>
<li>Exponential backoff</li>
<li>Multiple endpoints</li>
<li>Manual Retries</li>
<li>Rate Limits</li>
<li>Logs of all retries</li>
<li>Signature Verification</li>
<li>Circuit breakers</li>

</ol></li>
<li>Ingestion: Rate limits, automatic + manual retries, multiple
targets</li>
<li>Transformation: Serverless function support to transform payload
with ingestion features</li>
<li>Managed Version: Bring in your machines and we will take care of
running the software on it for your <strong>data privacy &amp;
safety</strong></li>
<li>Visibility &amp; alerts for frequently failed endpoints</li>
<li>Static source IPs</li>
<li>SSO</li>
<li>SDKs for your tech stack</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Fine-grained user permissions</li>
<li>and many more</li>
</ol>
<p>I want to build something which works for <strong>YOU</strong>, and I
want to give you a chance to participate in shaping the features which
are built, and understand what else can be done to make your life
easier.</p>
