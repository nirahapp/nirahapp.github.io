				</div>
				<div>
					<p>Do <i>you</i> want a webhook solution which works very well with unreliable user endpoints, gives you monitoring & visibility into your systems, offers rate limiting for endpoints, can tackle a host of security concerns, and offers a great development experience by minimizing operational work that engineers have to do?
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p><b>Do <i>you</i> really want to assign a team of 3-4 engineers for 4-6 months and thus spend Rs. 1.5-2 Cr/500-600k USD in salaries and build it yourself?</b>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>Our founder, Pranit Bauva, who built the Reverse Penny Drop product for Setu (FinTech), had to implement a full-fledged webhook system by hand since webhooks were a critical component of the system. He had to frequently attend customer calls to dissuade them from pooling, and helped build TRUST in asynchronous communication between server. At one point he realized that processing webhooks is a problem which is faced by many engineers and there should exists a solution so as to enable people and businesses do what they do best without worrying about sending webhooks.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>Our mission is to make asynchronous communication between servers as smooth as possible and we want to know your pain points and how we can provide value to you which is why we ask your email.
