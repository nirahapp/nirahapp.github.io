					<p><b>Do YOU have to send webhooks to your customers?</b></p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>Do YOU want a webhook solution which works very well with unreliable user endpoints, gives you monitoring & visibility into your systems, offers rate limiting for endpoints, can tackle a host of security concerns, and offers a great development experience by minimizing operational work that engineers have to do?
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p><b>Do YOU really want to assign a team of 3-4 engineers for 4-6 months and thus spend Rs. 1.5-2 Cr/500-600k USD in salaries and build it yourself?</b>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>Our founder, Pranit Bauva, who built the Reverse Penny Drop product for Setu (FinTech), had to implement this by hand since webhooks were a very critical component of the system. He had to frequently attend customer calls to dissuade them from pooling, and led the effort to build a very reliable webhook system with TRUST in asynchronous communication. At one point he realized that this is a problem which is faced by many people and there should exists a solution so as to enable people and businesses do what they do best without worrying about sending webhooks.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>Our mission is to make asynchronous communication between servers as smooth as possible, and we are building this for YOU. We want to give YOU a chance to shape the features we build so that this product works for YOU and it does things which make sense for YOU which is why we ask for your email below so that we can reach out to you and understand how we can provide value to you before we go ahead and build it.
